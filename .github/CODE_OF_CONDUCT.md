# Code of Conduct

By partaking in our community you agree with our code of conduct.
The code of conduct outlines a set of social norms expected from an individual in the community.

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of tModLoader is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in tModLoader to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

-   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
-   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
-   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
-   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
-   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community organizers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
-   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Rules are made by the community organizers, so they don't have to constantly state what is not acceptable, the organizers however are not bound by these rules. The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

-   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
-   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
-   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.

-   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
-   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
-   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
-   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations, or any other form of communication between collaborators and other community members.
-   Use of modified disruptive items, such as "zalgo" text or "memes", be it in names, messages or otherwise posted content through other means.
-   (Continuous- or singular) abuse of mentioning a person or a group of people in particular to their disliking in public chat or in private chat (this is treated as stalking).
-   (Continuous- or singular) disruptive communication in public conversations ("spam").
-   (Continuous- or singular) abuse of false reports about other community members.
-   The advertisement of other communities or products (be it within the same platform or another) without explicit permission of a community administrator.
-   Avoiding a temporary or sustained (permanent) ban, via any means such as using a VPN or registering new accounts and things alike.
-   Failing to comply when a community organizer takes action against unacceptable behavior, which does not necessarily have to be stated in the code of conduct. A community organizer may take action whenever deemed necessary against a community member.
-	Unnecessarily provoking or harassing any community organizer (staff, administrator or moderator) in public or private (out of spite, wanting to appeal judgement(s) cast by any of the community organizers, or things alike). See section 7 to learn more about the ability to have your grievance(s) addressed. 
-   Talking about illicit subjects, provided illegality can be proven, which is inclusive to the talk about use or sharing of pirated copies of Terraria or modified content (such as files and hyperlinks) to contain _any form of malware or other modifications that could otherwise harm a person's computer_
-   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

**Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.**

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

The community organizers are to ensure the ability of fair appealment in the case of a temporary (or otherwise known-as "softban"). A community member can do so by speaking and appealing their ban in a designated channel for this purpose. Such channel should become exposed to any community member that has been temporarily expelled from the community. The community organizers should try to make meets end, and ensure the community member in question understands their behavior was unacceptable. **In no event shall a community organizer be held liable in case of temporary or permanent expulsion from the community or failing to allow the member in question to be accepted into the community again, whether in an action of agreement, tort or otherwise, arising from the judgement performed on the member in question.**

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. This is best done in the community server by contacting one of the administrators or moderators _privately_.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events it is not in the jurisdiction of the community organizers to dedicate themselves to providing escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress, but they may be able to help the member get in touch with people who can.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify a community organizer _in private_ with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. 

In case of unjustful expulsion from the community it is the expectation of the community managers to ensure the member in question is able to rejoin the community in welcoming and safe manner.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; regulars; and other guests or community members) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
