      Please **look at the FAQ before** submitting an issue. Your issue might be well known with an easy fix. [Basic tModLoader Usage FAQ](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-FAQ) 
      Please fill out all the necessary details. 
      Please only report an issue if you are certain there's a problem with the tModLoader software.

      If you are having trouble with **a specific mod**, please report that to the mod's author, not here.

      If you are having trouble installing tModLoader, that is not suitable for the bug tracker. That is a support question, not a bug. For support questions, you should go to [Discord](http://discord.gg/tmodloader)
      Please read the pinned messages in the `#support-forum` channel beforehand.
