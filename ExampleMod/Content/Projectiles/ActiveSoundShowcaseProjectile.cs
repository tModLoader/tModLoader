			FireAndForget,
			// This example improves on FireAndForget. The Projectile position is passed into PlaySound. The sound still does not update location, but the player can move around the initial spawn location and the sound pans and volume adjusts accordingly.
			FireAndForgetPlusInitialPosition,
			// Further improving on FireAndForgetPlusInitialPosition, this example updates the sound location in AI and stops the sound when the projectile is killed in Kill.
			SyncSoundToProjectilePosition,
			// Further improving on SyncSoundToProjectilePosition, this example uses the SoundUpdateCallback parameter to keep all sound logic organized in a single place instead of spread between different methods.
			SoundUpdateCallbackApproach,
			// LoopedSound shows using SoundUpdateCallback once again to adjust sound position. The SoundStyle used is looped, so SoundUpdateCallback is necessary in case Projectile.Kill doesn't get called for some exceptional reason.
			LoopedSound,
			// LoopedSoundAdvanced adjusts pitch and volume dynamically in the SoundUpdateCallback, in addition to the usual sound position.

In some situations the modder might want to restart a sound when the game is focused again, in other situations that might not be desired. Some of these examples use a bool, "played", to track if the sound has been played since the projectile spawned, while others do not and will attempt to restart the sound if it is not currently playing.

			// Also note that in this example the SoundStyle all have "MaxInstances = 1" and "SoundLimitBehavior = SoundLimitBehavior.ReplaceOldest" by default, so if 2 projectiles attempt to play the same sound, they'll constantly interrupt each other every AI update, making a horrible sound.
			// In a real mod, the modder should design the SoundStyle properties and PlaySound logic to meet their needs. For example, the modder might decide that 3 overlapping sounds is too chaotic and adjust MaxInstances accordingly. The modder might also decide that the sound should not restart when the game is re-focused and use logic to only attempt to play the sound once.
