	// This file showcases the concept of piercing.
	// The code of the item that spawns it is located at the bottom.

	// NPC.immune determines if an npc can be hit by a item or projectile owned by a particular player (it is an array, each slot corresponds to different players (whoAmI))
	// NPC.immune is decremented towards 0 every update
	// Melee items set NPC.immune to player.itemAnimation, which starts at item.useAnimation and decrements towards 0
	// Projectiles, however, provide mechanisms for custom immunity.
	// 1. penetrate == 1: A projectile with penetrate set to 1 in SetDefaults will hit regardless of the npc's immunity counters (The penetrate from SetDefaults is remembered in maxPenetrate)
	//	Ex: Wooden Arrow.
	// 2. No code and penetrate > 1 or -1: npc.immune[owner] will be set to 10.
	// 	The NPC will be hit if not immune and will become immune to all damage for 10 ticks
	// 	Ex: Unholy Arrow
	// 3. Override OnHitNPC: If not immune, when it hits it manually set an immune other than 10
	// 	Ex: Arkhalis: Sets it to 5
	// 	Ex: Sharknado Minion: Sets to 20
	// 	Video: https://gfycat.com/DisloyalImprobableHoatzin Notice how Sharknado minion hits prevent Arhalis hits for a brief moment.
	// 4. Projectile.usesIDStaticNPCImmunity and Projectile.idStaticNPCHitCooldown: Specifies that a type of projectile has a shared immunity timer for each npc.
	// 	Use this if you want other projectiles a chance to damage, but don't want the same projectile type to hit an npc rapidly.
	// 	Ex: Ghastly Glaive is the only one who uses this.
	// 5. Projectile.usesLocalNPCImmunity and Projectile.localNPCHitCooldown: Specifies the projectile manages it's own immunity timers for each npc
	// 	Use this if you want the multiple projectiles of the same type to have a chance to attack rapidly, but don't want a single projectile to hit rapidly. A -1 value prevents the same projectile from ever hitting the npc again.
	// 	Ex: Lightning Aura sentries use this. (localNPCHitCooldown = 3, but other code controls how fast the projectile itself hits)
	// 		Overlapping Auras all have a chance to hit after each other even though they share the same ID.
	// Try the above by uncommenting out the respective bits of code in the projectile below.
