	/// <summary>
	/// This item can help conceptualize various damage modification concepts. <br/>
	/// The Item.damage of this weapon is 100 so the math is easy to follow. Damage variation is disabled for all modes except the 1st mode for the same reason. <br/>
	/// When testing this weapon the first time, it is recommended to disable other mods and to remove all damage boosting accessories, as they will complicate the math being taught. <br/>
	/// Testing against <see cref="NPCID.BlueArmoredBonesNoPants"/> is recommended as it has high defense (50), good knockback resistance, and enough health for a few hits. Having 50 defense makes the math for defense and armor penetration easy to follow.
	/// <br/>
	/// The math taught in this example also assumes the player is in a normal world. <br/> 
	/// Use right click to switch modes.<br/>
	/// This example is purely for demonstration purposes only, it will not work in multiplayer. This should also not be considered correct code for a working dual-use weapon. <br/>
