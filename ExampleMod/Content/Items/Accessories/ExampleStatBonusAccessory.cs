			// GetDamage returns a reference to the specified damage class' damage StatModifier.
			// Since it doesn't return a value, but a reference to it, you can freely modify it with mathematics operators (+, -, *, /, etc.).
			// StatModifier is a structure that separately holds float additive and multiplicative modifiers, as well as base damage and flat damage.
			// When StatModifier is applied to a value, its additive modifiers are applied before multiplicative ones.
			// Base damage is added directly to the weapon's base damage and is affected by damage bonuses, while flat damage is applied after all other calculations.
			// In this case, we're doing a number of things:
			// - Adding 25% damage, additively. This is the typical "X% damage increase" that accessories use, use this one.
			// - Adding 12% damage, multiplicatively. This effect is almost never used in Terraria, typically you want to use the additive multiplier above. It is extremely hard to correctly balance the game with multiplicative bonuses.
			// - Adding 4 base damage.
			// - Adding 5 flat damage.
			// Since we're using DamageClass.Generic, these bonuses apply to ALL damage the player deals.
			player.GetDamage(DamageClass.Generic) += AdditiveDamageBonus / 100f;

			// GetCrit, similarly to GetDamage, returns a reference to the specified damage class' crit chance.
			// In this case, we're adding 10% crit chance, but only for the melee DamageClass (as such, only melee weapons will receive this bonus).
			// NOTE: Once all crit calculations are complete, a weapon or class' total crit chance is typically cast to an int. Plan accordingly.
			player.GetCritChance(DamageClass.Melee) += MeleeCritBonus;

			// GetAttackSpeed is functionally identical to GetDamage and GetKnockback; it's for attack speed.
			// In this case, we'll make ranged weapons 15% faster to use overall.
			// NOTE: Zero or a negative value as the result of these calculations will throw an exception. Plan accordingly.
			player.GetAttackSpeed(DamageClass.Ranged) += RangedAttackSpeedBonus / 100f;

			// GetArmorPenetration is functionally identical to GetCritChance, but for the armor penetration stat instead.
			// In this case, we'll add 5 armor penetration to magic weapons.
			// NOTE: Once all armor pen calculations are complete, the final armor pen amount is cast to an int. Plan accordingly.
			player.GetArmorPenetration(DamageClass.Magic) += MagicArmorPenetration;

			// GetKnockback is functionally identical to GetDamage, but for the knockback stat instead.
			// In this case, we're adding 100% knockback additively, but only for our custom example DamageClass (as such, only our example class weapons will receive this bonus).
