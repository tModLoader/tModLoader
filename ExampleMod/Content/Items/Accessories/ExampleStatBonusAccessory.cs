			// StatModifier is a structure that separately holds float additive and multiplicative modifiers, as well as base damage and flat damage.
			// When StatModifier is applied to a value, its additive modifiers are applied before multiplicative ones.
			// Base damage is added directly to the weapon's base damage and is affected by damage bonuses, while flat damage is applied after all other calculations.
			// In this case, we're doing a number of things:
			// - Adding 25% damage, additively. This is the typical "X% damage increase" that accessories use, use this one.
			// - Adding 12% damage, multiplicatively. This effect is almost never used in Terraria, typically you want to use the additive multiplier above. It is extremely hard to correctly balance the game with multiplicative bonuses.
			// - Adding 4 base damage.
			// - Adding 5 flat damage.
