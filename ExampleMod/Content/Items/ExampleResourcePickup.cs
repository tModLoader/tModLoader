	// Pickups usually provide resources to the player, such as hearts providing life or stars providing mana. Nebula armor boosters are another example.
	// This example drops from enemies when Example Resource is low, similar to how hearts and stars only drop if the player is lacking health or mana.
	// See ExampleResourcePickupGlobalNPC for the item drop code.
