			// This code is needed to customize the vanity pet display in the player select screen. Quick explanation:
			// * It uses fluent API syntax, just like Recipe
			// * You start with ProjectileID.Sets.SimpleLoop, specifying the start and end frames as well as the speed, and optionally if it should animate from the end after reaching the end, effectively "bouncing"
			// * To stop the animation if the player is not highlighted/is standing, as done by most grounded pets, add a .WhenNotSelected(0, 0) (you can customize it just like SimpleLoop)
			// * To set offset and direction, use .WithOffset(x, y) and .WithSpriteDirection(-1)
			// * To further customize the behavior and animation of the pet (as its AI does not run), you have access to a few vanilla presets in DelegateMethods.CharacterPreview to use via .WithCode(). You can also make your own, showcased in MinionBossPetProjectile
