This is a Basic Setup Guide for any CI tool for Mod Building & Publishing. You will need to consult your tool of choice for how to create a workflow, 
	and for setting up the appropriate version of .NET and related build dependencies.

NOTE: The following is based on a windows CI environment. For a Unix environment, you will need to use the appropriate version of SteamCMD, 
	and an appropriate port of PublishWorkshopItem.bat. Some may feel more comfortable directly porting the batch script in to the CI workflow.

Copy the following files from ExampleMod/CIBuildTool to YourModName/CIBuildTool
1) Instructions.txt
2) SteamdCMD.exe
3) PublishWorkshopItem.bat

FOR Github Actions Only:
1) Copy the .github folder from ExampleMod/CIBuildTool to YourModName's root folder
2) Configure you're github secrets

Modify your csproj:
1) Remove "Import Project="../tmodloader.targets"
2) Add lines
  <Import Project="../tModLoader.targets" Condition="Exists('../tModLoader.targets')"/>
  <Import Project="CIBuildTool/Mod Sources/tModLoader.targets" Condition="Exists('CIBuildTool/Mod Sources/tModLoader.targets')"/>

Run SteamCMD, use the following commands, in order, to get the Steam Sentry Files:
1) login <username>
2) set_steam_guard_code <code>
This will generate two important files that you will than need to add/verify/keep in your CIBuildTool folder: 
1) <steam>\ssfn<HashOfNumbers> is the sentry file
2) <steam>\config is the config

Finally, now that you have all the needed files, you can Invoke PublishWorkshopItem.bat in your CI to do Mod Building & Publishing, w/ parameters
1)  Mandatory - Steam Account USERNAME 
2)  Mandatory - Steam Account PASSWORD
3)  Optional - Change Notes
