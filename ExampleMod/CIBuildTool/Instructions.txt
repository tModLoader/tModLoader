This is a Basic Setup Guide for any CI tool for Mod Building & Publishing. You will need to consult your tool of choice for how to create a workflow, 
	and for setting up the appropriate version of .NET and related build dependencies.

NOTE: The following is based on a windows CI environment. For a Unix environment, you will need to use the appropriate version of SteamCMD, 
	and an appropriate port of PublishWorkshopItem.bat. Some may feel more comfortable directly porting the batch script in to the CI workflow.

Copy the following files from ExampleMod/CIBuildTool to YourModName/CIBuildTool
1) Instructions.txt
2) SteamdCMD.exe
3) PublishWorkshopItem.bat

Run SteamCMD, use the following commands, in order:
1) login <username>
2) set_steam_guard_code <code>
This will generate two important files that you will than need to add to your CIBuildTool folder: 
1) <steam>\ssfn<HashOfNumbers> is the sentry file
2) <steam>\config\config.vdf is the config

Finally, now that you have all the needed files, you can Invoke PublishWorkshopItem.bat in your CI to do Mod Building & Publishing, w/ parameters
1)  Mandatory - Steam Account USERNAME 
2)  Mandatory - Steam Account PASSWORD
3)  Optional - Change Notes
