	/// This is an enum of the types of sound you can add to the game. This is used for determining whether a sound is a music or a sound effect. If it's a sound effect, it's also used for determining the "type" passed to Main.PlaySound (first parameter) that is required in order for a sound to play; 2 for item sounds, 3 for npcHit sounds, 4 for npcKilled sounds, and SoundLoader.customSoundType for anything else.
