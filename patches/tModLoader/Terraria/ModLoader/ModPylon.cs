/// Extension to <seealso cref="ModTile"/> that streamlines the process of creating a
/// modded Pylon. Has all of ModTile's hooks for customization, but additional hooks for
/// Pylon functionality.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// One of the key features of this class is the <b>ValidTeleportCheck</b> process. At first glance it can look a bit
/// messy, however here is a rough break-down of the call process to help you if you're lost:
/// <br></br>
/// 1) Game queries if the specified player is near a Pylon (<seealso cref="TeleportPylonsSystem.IsPlayerNearAPylon"/>)
/// <br></br>
/// 2) Assuming Step 1 has passed, game queries if the DESTINATION PYLON (the pylon the player CLICKED on the map) has enough NPCs nearby (NPCCount step)
/// <br></br>
/// 3) Assuming Step 2 has passed, game queries if there is ANY DANGER at ALL across the entire map, ignoring the lunar pillar event (AnyDanger step)
/// <br></br>
/// 4) Assuming Step 3 has passed, game queries if the DESTINATION PYLON is in the Lihzahrd Temple before Plantera is defeated.
/// <br></br>
/// 5) Assuming Step 4 has passed, game queries if the DESTINATION PYLON meets its biome specifications for whatever type of pylon it is (BiomeRequirements step)
/// <br></br>
/// 6) Regardless of all the past checks, if the DESTINATION PYLON is a modded one, <seealso cref="ValidTeleportCheck_DestinationPostCheck"/> is called on it.
/// <br></br>
/// 7) The game queries all pylons on the map and checks if any of them are in interaction distance with the player (<seealso cref="Player.InInteractionRange"/>), and if so, checks Step 2 on it. If Step 2 passes, Step 5 is then called on it as well (NPCCount &amp; BiomeRequirements step).
/// If Step 5 also passes, the loop breaks and no further pylons are checked, and for the next steps, the pylon that succeeded will be the designated NEARBY PYLON.
/// <br></br>
/// 8) Regardless of all the past checks, if the designated NEARBY PYLON is a modded one, <seealso cref="ValidTeleportCheck_NearbyPostCheck"/> is called on it.
/// <br></br>
/// 9) Any <seealso cref="GlobalPylon"/> instances run <seealso cref="GlobalPylon.PostValidTeleportCheck"/>.
/// <br></br>
/// 10) Finally, if all previous checks pass AND the DESTINATION pylon is a modded one, <seealso cref="ModifyTeleportationPosition"/> is called on it, right before the player is teleported.
