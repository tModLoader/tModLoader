#This is an example config file for tModLoader
#tModLoader config files work exactly the same as Terraria, but instead of launching the .exe file, the .bat file is launched. 
#Note that unless a world is specified, some settings like max player count, port, and port forwarding will be ignored.  
#In addition, tModLoader config files support tModLoader specific options.
#By default, the config file named serverconfig.txt will automatically be used by the server.
#The config file used can be customized. Use the command 'start-tModLoaderServer.bat -config configFileHere.txt' to use a specific config file instead.
#More details can be found at https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Command-Line and https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Starting-a-modded-server
