# Dedicated Server Utils
This directory contains utilities for a dedicated ***Linux*** or Docker server.

### Installation Options
**Currently ARM support does not exist for the Docker installation, so the management script must be used**. While both the Docker container and the management script can install and update tModLoader and any mods, there are a few key differences. Docker isolates tModLoader from your host system, allowing for less manual management and increased security. The management script allows for direct access to your server and increased control as a result.

[Management Script](#using-the-management-script)

## Using The Management Script
The `manage-tModLoaderServer.sh` script can be used to install tModLoader either directly from the GitHub release or from SteamCMD. The script is made to run fully standalone, so just download it to your server and run it. No other files from the repo are needed.

### Installing tModLoader
**Note:** SteamCMD does not have an ARM build currently. The only way to install tModLoader in this case is via [Github](#github).
#### SteamCMD (recommended)
* Ensure SteamCMD is installed and on your PATH. You can install SteamCMD from your package manager or [Valve's Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD).
* Run `./manage-tModLoaderServer.sh --install --username your_steam_username`.
* You will be prompted for your password (and your 2fa code if applicable).
* By default, tModLoader will be installed to `~/Steam/steamapps/common/tModLoader`. To specify an installation directory, use `--folder /full/path/from/root`

#### GitHub
* Run `./manage-tModLoaderServer.sh --install --github`.
* By default, tModLoader will be installed to `~/tModLoader`. To specify an installation directory, use `--folder /path/to/install`.
* This will install the latest GitHub release, which is the same version as released on Steam.

### Installing Mods
Mods will be automatically installed during the tModLoader installation step, but can also be installed separately using the `--mods-only` argument. Simply place any `.tmod` files, `install.txt` for workshop mods, and `enabled.json` into the same directory as the script. Additionally, you can avoid updating or installing mods with the `--no-mods` argument.

#### Obtaining install.txt
Because the steam workshop does not use mod names to identify mods, you must create a modpack to install mods from the workshop. To get an `install.txt` file and its accompanying `enabled.json`:
* Go to Workshop
* Go to Mod Packs
* Click `Save Enabled as New Mod Pack`
* Click `Open Mod Pack Folder`.
* Enter the folder with the name of your modpack

You can copy `enabled.json` and `install.txt` to your script directory and they will be used next time the script is run (run `./manage-tModLoaderServer.sh --mods-only` to install mods immediately).

### Launching
To start a server, run `./manage-tModLoaderServer.sh --start`. The `--start` flag can be added to the installation process above to automatically start the server. Be sure to pass in `--folder` again if you used it during installation. The server can also be started by navigating to tModLoader's installation directory (Default `~/tModLoader` for GitHub, `~/Steam/steamapps/common/tModLoader` for SteamCMD) and running `./start-tModLoaderServer.sh`

### Updating
If an update for `manage-tModLoaderServer.sh` is available, a message will be printed letting you know one is available. It can be updated using `./manage-tModLoaderServer.sh --update-script`. An outdated script may contain bugs or lack features, so it is usually a good idea to update.

When using `manage-tModLoaderServer.sh`, tModLoader updates can be performed with `./manage-tModLoaderServer.sh --update`. When using a GitHub install, use `--github`. Use`--folder` if your install is in a non-standard location. Mods will be updated as well.

### Autostarting On Boot
Refer to your distro's documentation. You can likely use a startup script with your init system to run the commands from the Launching section.

## Using The Docker Container
To install and run the container:
* Install `docker` from your package manager or [Docker's Official Page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  * **To check if Compose V2 is installed in this package**, run `docker compose version`. If the command errors, your manager still uses V1 and will need to additionally install the `docker-compose` package. All commands below assume Compose V2 is installed, so if you have V1 replace any `docker compose` commands with `docker-compose`
* Download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/tree/1.4.4/patches/tModLoader/Terraria/release_extras/DedicatedServerUtils/Docker/docker-compose.yml) and the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/tree/1.4.4/patches/tModLoader/Terraria/release_extras/DedicatedServerUtils/Docker/Dockerfile).
* Next to those docker files, create a folder named `Terraria`, and place `enabled.json`, [install.txt](#obtaining-install.txt), [serverconfig.txt](#server-configuration), your worlds, and any `.tmod` files inside.
* Edit `docker-compose.yml` with your GID and UID. These can be found by running `id`.
* Run `docker compose build`
* Run `docker compose up`
  * To run without any interactivity, use `docker compose up -d`, and include [serverconfig.txt](#server-configuration) in the `Terraria` directory.

The server will be available on port 7777.

To attach to the server console, run `docker ps` to get the container ID and `docker attach CTID` to attach to it. To detach from the console press `Ctrl-P Ctrl-Q` to avoid shutting down or `Ctrl-C` to detach and shutdown the server.

### Updating
To update, rebuild the container using `docker compose build` to update tModLoader. Mods will be updated as well.

### Autostarting On Boot
Add `restart: always` within `services.tml` inside of `docker-compose.yml`, then rebuild with `docker compose build`.

## Server Configuration
If you want to run tModLoader without needing any input on startup (such as from an init system), then all you need to do is copy the example [serverconfig.txt](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/tree/1.4.4/patches/tModLoader/Terraria/release_extras/serverconfig.txt) and change the settings how you like. Key options are defined below, and other options can be found [on the Terraria wiki](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Server#Server_config_file)

### World Name
Setting `worldname` will change the default world name when creating a new world using [autocreate](#autocreate) **You do not need to include .wld in your world name**

### Autocreate
Set `autocreate=1` in your world to automatically make a new world if the path in `world` or a world with `worldname` does not exist.
