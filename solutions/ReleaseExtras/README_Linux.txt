Automatic Install:
To install tModLoader, extract the tar.gz archive containing this README.txt file to a temporary folder and then simply run the tModLoaderInstaller.jar file in that folder. Java 1.8 or higher is required for the installer to run. The installer will make a window pop up, informing you of either success or failure. If you have changed the steam library location or are on GOG, the installer might ask you where you installed Terraria. If for some reason the installer doesn't work, you'll need to follow the Manual Install instructions.

Manual Install:
If the installer for some reason does not work, or if you do not want to install/upgrade Java, you may also do a manual install:

Steam Manual Install:
1.  Go to the Terraria install folder (the one containing Terraria.exe, not the Saves folder). For older installations of Steam, this will be "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria". For newer installations of Steam, this will be "~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Terraria". If you can't find it, view this video: https://gfycat.com/SelfreliantAssuredIsabellineshrike

2.  Back-up your vanilla Terraria.exe if you haven't already. To do this, rename the "Terraria.exe" file in the install folder to "Terraria_v1.3.5.3.exe".

3.  Copy all of the files from the temporary folder (or tar.gz archive) into the install folder. You'll need to make sure to replace files if asked: https://gfycat.com/EqualFaithfulAfricanharrierhawk

4. Run Terraria as normal. If it doesn't run, you might need to give execute permissions to 2 files. If so, open a terminal in the install directory and run the following 2 commands:
    chmod +x tModLoaderServer
    chmod +x Terraria

GOG Manual Install:
For GOG installs, follow the Steam Manual Install instructions above but with the location of your GOG install of Terraria. Don't skip the backing up vanilla "Terraria.exe" step or it won't work.

Run tModLoader:
To run tModLoader, run Terraria as normal from Steam. Do not attempt to run it from the temporary folder. If you see Mods or Mod Browser on the main menu in Terraria, you have successfully installed tModLoader.

Why are there EXE files?:
Don't worry about it, you didn't download the wrong thing.

Uninstall/Switch back to un-modded Terraria:
If you want to play un-modded Terraria or join an un-modded Terraria server, you can't use tModLoader. You need to use steam to "verify game integrity" which will restore the files back to the un-modded Terraria. (You'll need to reinstall tModLoader later.) See this video to see how to do that: https://gfycat.com/RapidBelovedFrog

Dedicated tModLoader server:
If you are installing tModLoader onto a machine that will be running a dedicated server, you'll need to install the un-modded Terraria server first: http://terraria.org/server/terraria-server-1353.zip  After installing, you can follow the manual install instructions to copy the tModLoader files into the folder you installed the server into.
