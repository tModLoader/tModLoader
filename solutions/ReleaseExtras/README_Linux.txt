Automatic Install:
To install tModLoader, simply run the tModLoaderInstaller.jar file after extracting these file to a temporary folder. Java 1.7 or higher is required for the installer to run. The installer will make a window pop up, informing you of either success or failure.

Manual Install:
If the installer for some reason does not work, or if you do not want to install/upgrade Java, you may also do a manual install.  You may wish to back-up your vanilla Terraria.exe first.

1.  Go to your Terraria's Steam folder (the one containing Terraria.exe).  For older installations of Steam, this will be "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria".  For newer installations of Steam, this will be "~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Terraria".

2.  Copy all of these files into that folder.

3.  Additionally, if you are updating from 0.10.1.5 or earlier, you'll need to delete "MP3Sharp.dll", "Ionic.Zip.Reduced.dll", and "Mono.Cecil.dll" from that folder.

GOG Install:
For GOG installs, follow the manual install instructions above.

Run tModLoader:
To run tModLoader, run Terraria as normal from Steam. Do not attempt to run it from this folder if you used the installer.

Why are there EXE files?:
Don't worry about it, you didn't download the wrong thing.

Uninstall/Switch back to un-modded Terraria:
If you want to play un-modded Terraria or join a un-modded Terraria server, you can't use tModLoader. You need to use steam to "verify game integrity" which will restore the files back to the un-modded Terraria. (You'll need to reinstall tModLoader later.) See this video to see how to do that: https://gfycat.com/RapidBelovedFrog

Dedicated tModLoader server:
If you are installing tModLoader onto a machine without steam that will be running a dedicated server, you'll need to install the un-modded Terraria server first: http://terraria.org/server/terraria-server-1353.zip  After installing, you can follow the manual install instructions to copy the tModLoader files into the folder you installed the server into.

Also note that the server can be started by running the "tModLoaderServer" script, in this case you need to give execute permission to both the script and the binary executable it wants to run e.g. "tModLoaderServer.x86_64"
