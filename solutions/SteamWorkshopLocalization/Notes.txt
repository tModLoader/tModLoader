The tags and categories on the workshop can be localized. This script is used to update the steam tag localization files to be in sync with the tModLoader localization files. A tModLoader Team member will run this script and upload tags whenever new tags are added or whenever tag localizations are updated in any language. 

1. If new tags are added to tModLoader, first download each of the tag localization files. 

2. Run the script. 

3. Upload each file to steam. It will take 30 minutes to be live. If any categories names were updated, make sure to publish in steam as well.

TODO: Not sure what to do about similar languages: latin america spanish, traditional chinese, portugal portuguese
