# tModLoader, a Terraria modding API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tModLoader/tModLoader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tModLoader/tModLoader) [![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/103110554649894912/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.me/tmodloader)

## About

tModLoader is an API for Terraria that provides a way to create and load mods without having to work with Terraria's source code directly. This means you can easily make mods that are compatible with other mods and save yourself the trouble of having to decompile then recompile Terraria.exe. This also means players can use multiple mods at the same time without having to worry about compatibility issues. Traditionally most mods (standalone mods) that don't have an API like tModLoader to handle them will be incompatible with each other. tModLoader is made to work for Terraria version 1.3 and above. To view our releases you can go to the [releases page](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/releases) which will include the binaries required to install tModLoader. 

Our goal for tModLoader is to make it simple as possible to mod while giving the modder powerful control over the game. It is designed in a way as to minimize the effort required for us to update to future Terraria versions. If you either don't want to commit to this project or are not able to decompile Terraria, we are open to suggestions for hooks and/or modifications. Please use our [github issues section](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/issues) to do this (you can ignore the default format for suggestions) You can also contact us through our Discord server.

**NOTE**: this repository will be ahead of the current released version.

## Support us

The best way to support us is by becoming a patron on our [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/tModLoader).
You can choose whatever amount of money you'd like to support us with (starting from $1, capping at $15000) either as a monthly 'subscription' or as a one-time payment. We highly appreciate it if you do. Supporting us also comes with various rewards, such as being included in our credits section.

The money that we earn from our Patreon will be initially used to pay for server costs (for the Mod Browser), if the amount grows big enough we might get our own web host for a website. For now, the revenue will be used just to pay for Mod Browser uptime and availability. Thank you in advance for supporting us, whether you decide to become a patron or not!
